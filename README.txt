SKORE (Smart Keyboard Operated by Robotic Educator)

Description:

This is my Electrical Senior Design Project. Eventually, this code will provided
with the user the capability of importing .mp3 and .pdf music files and convert
them into .midi and .pdf files. Additional software and hardware will be
utilized to guide the user with an LED rod, above the piano keyboard. Three
different modes of tutoring will be created: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert.

Beginner Mode will indicate the user of the finger placements and wait until the
user presses the key.

Intermediate Mode will play the song at a tunable speed and the user must follow
along.

Expert Mode will only light up the LED rod if the user incorrectly plays the
notes, this way the user test their knowledge of the piece.

Expected time for project and proper documentation completion: March 2019
